# Server code for cl-dash

Make sure that you have done / are doing the following before asking me for help:

-   Using python 3.9
-   Installed dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

-   Have set up database

```bash
py setup_database.py
```

-   Are running the server with one of the provided scripts, not directly with Python

```bash
# Good!

.\dev.bat
# OR
dev.sh
# OR
.\run_server.bat
# OR
run_server.sh
```

```bash
# BAD!!!

py server.py
```
